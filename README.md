### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Currently I'm a software engineer living in New York City, recently graduated from Queens College with a degree in Computer Science. 
I'm working on some of my own side projects currently in between my own self study and trying to land my first Software Development job.

âš¡ Fun fact: My favorite drink is anything that has caffeine.
